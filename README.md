# RoamRoutely 

<li>RoamRoutely is an innovative automated travel itinerary generator designed to streamline the process of trip planning. Here's an elaboration on how it works:</li>

1. User Input: Users input their travel preferences through a form provided by RoamRoutely. This form collects information such as destination, travel dates, budget, interests, and any specific requirements.
   
2. Filtering Algorithm: RoamRoutely employs a sophisticated filtering algorithm to process the user's preferences. This algorithm sifts through a vast database of travel data to find the most relevant options.

3. Filtration Process: During the filtration process, the algorithm considers various factors such as transportation options, accommodation availability, popular attractions, dining preferences, and local events.

4. Itinerary Generation: Based on the filtered data, RoamRoutely generates a personalized travel itinerary for the user. This itinerary includes recommendations for activities, sightseeing spots, restaurants, and accommodations that align with the user's preferences and constraints.

5. Presentation: The generated itinerary is presented to the user in an easy-to-read format, detailing each day's activities, travel arrangements, and other relevant information.

6. Customization: Users have the option to customize their itinerary further if desired. They can make adjustments to the suggested activities, add or remove destinations, and modify the schedule according to their preferences.

7. Finalization: Once the itinerary is finalized, users can review and confirm their travel plans through the RoamRoutely platform.
